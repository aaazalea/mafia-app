The serial killer may attempt to kill any player by tapping them on the shoulder and saying \"BANG\". If the kill succeeds, or if the serial killer was disarmed, then they can't make another kill until three days later (for example, if you make a kill at any time on Thursday, you cannot make a kill again until after day end on Saturday). The same serial killer may not try to kill the same person twice on the same day.\r\nThe mafia are allowed to give anyone they want mafia den access, but they should be wary that some players might pretend to be serial killers to gain information on the mafia.\r\nA serial killer has 3 free no-kill days. Every day that they could make a kill but do not, they lose one of these no-kill days. If they fail to make a kill when they could have, and have already used up all their no-kill days, they die of bloodlust. For example, if they make kills on days 1, 4, 7, they have not used up any of these three days; if they make kills on days 2 and 6 they will die at the end of day 10, having used their no-kill days on days 1, 5, and 9.\r\nIf the serial killer tries to kill someone and fails because the target was immune, they can make another kill the same day, but they cannot try to kill the same person again on the same day (this is separate from the mafia's restriction). They cannot make another kill that day if they were disarmed.\r\nIf a serial killer visits a kill site (of a kill made by someone other than themself) before at least 3 investigators have visited that kill site, the serial killer may make one investigation about the kill. This allows them to find the mafia more easily. Any role that visits a kill site in order to gain investigative powers counts toward those 3 investigators.\r\n"
